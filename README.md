# russian-deconverter

My first project, built on my 5th day of programming in a couple hours.

I was using an online dictionary to learn Russian, but it didn't accept uppercase letters nor ё.
Everytime I'd copy a word that had a capital letter or a ё ("yo") in it, it was a pain in the ass to replace it manually in order to access the definition. Therefore I created this small gadgety thing to deconvert them to plain lowercase letters. 

How to use it: Right click to paste the word or string of characters, press enter, and voilà: the word automatically goes into your clipboard, ready to get pasted in the dictionary seatch bar.
